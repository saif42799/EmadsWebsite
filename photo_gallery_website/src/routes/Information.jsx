                <div className="box-2">
                    <p>I’m Emad Shaikh, a multidisciplinary graphic designer with over three years of experience crafting visuals that blend creativity, clarity, and impact. My journey started long before university, when I taught myself Photoshop and discovered how design could transform simple ideas into compelling stories. Since then, I’ve expanded my toolkit with Illustrator, InDesign, and motion and 3D tools like After Effects, Figma, Blender, and Cinema 4D. I constantly explore new ways to bring concepts to life.</p>

                <div className="box-4">
                    <p>I’ve worked on branding, packaging, and marketing projects, most recently at SK Imports, where I developed product-focused visuals and research-driven design assets. I thrive equally in independent projects and collaborative environments, always open to feedback and inspired by different perspectives.</p>

                    <p>Living and studying in the UK before moving to New York shaped my design approach with a global perspective. I find inspiration in everything from city streets and creative fields to the smallest details that often go unnoticed.</p>
